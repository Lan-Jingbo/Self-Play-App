But instead of tearing the nation apart, it united the people, created a strong public-private sector partnership fuelled by a &quot;never-say-die&quot; spirit and the sheer willpower not to go under. In facing these dangers, Singapore was irrevocably transformed. It chartered new paths for economic and tourism development, and turned over-cautious government agencies into nimble organisations.

Excessive carbon emission from fossil fuels is the main culprit, but can we cut our ties to carbon while advancing our civilization?</p>\n<p>Global carbon emission needs to stop increasing by 2020 in order to keep global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius within this century.

Scarcity, for so long a fundamental assumption in Economics, is due for a reassessment. The ubiquity of technology and the changing needs and wants of a generation coming into fore are the impetus; the urgency - an increasingly violent planet. We live in a time of unprecedented abundance, yet, scarcity persists. As a tool, technology has brought abundance to millions (see China) but it has also been used as a source of consumption that creates other wants. What must we do for a sustainable and equitable future? One person cannot answer every nuance of this complex question, but Aaron�s search takes him from the vast exteriors of Mongolia to the narrow interiors of the human psyche. Out of which, came a research paper, peer-reviewed, and housed online @ www.chasingscarcity.com, inviting as many people to the conversation as possible.</p>\n",

Young men in mandarin attire laugh and joke as they glance at the camera, eyeballing the 21st century viewer from the time of the Qing Dynasty.  Since those gentlemen were recorded on celluloid, China has experienced nearly 120 years of momentous change. These first fleeting images are part of a unique collection of early films at the British Film Institute (BFI), covering every facet of Chinese life from the time of the Boxer Rebellion to the Communist victory in 1949.   With unique access to the BFI National Archive, this 2-part documentary shows films never seen before this outside the UK. The best of these extraordinary images are worked into a compelling narrative to reveal new insights into this period of tremendous change and turmoil in China. Voiced by renowned cinematographer Christopher Doyle, the films capture a pre-CCP China in vivid motion.  </p>\n",

The Circular Economy? It is a buzzword nowadays, but its principles are based on pearls of wisdom. Circularity is production and consumption to create as little waste as possible.

In the first episode, Yumi meets the women who are re-defining their roles in Japan's patriarchal society, and the men forced to re-orientate themselves in this new social order. In episode two, Yumi dives into the country's extreme work culture, visiting obsessive farmers, overworked salarymen and the therapists trying to keep them sane. Next, Yumi visits hip hop dancing grannies and other members of the nation's sunset generation to find out how this fast-ageing country is coping with unprecedented demographic change. In the final episode, Yumi hangs out with bartending Buddhist monks, psychedelic pop artists, and shunned biracial communities to explore a national identity in flux and to decipher what it means to be Japanese today. </p>\n",

From Kabul to Ghazni, Channel NewsAsia obtained rare access into Taliban badlands to understand why the Taliban are gaining control of more territory 18 years since America invaded the country. On this journey, we embed with the Afghanistan Army on an operation against the Taliban and and investigate why they are fast losing soldiers to conflict and attrition. We also meet brave journalists and artistes who continue to fight for peace. Along the way, we speak to key stakeholders like former President Hamid Karzai who unveils his solution for a democratic, peaceful Afghanistan. But is this too little, too late, for a country that has failed to protect thousands of lives that have already been lost in a conflict that continues to get worse with every passing day?</p>\n",

Often described as savoury, meaty deliciousness, it comes down to the taste of glutamates on our tongue. Often misrepresented as the chemical MSG, Umami sensations are created when certain natural ingredients combine and synergize. The term was coined in the 20th century by a Japanese chemist but the concept of savoury deliciousness has been understood by cooks throughout the world and through history.  Now we want to explore the Umami secrets of some popular Asian foods. Host Robert Allison, trained chef, food stylist and cookery book writer from the UK travels from Seoul and Busan, to Hanoi, Singapore, Kelantan and Kuala Lumpur to peel open the umami secrets of home-grown dishes, local condiments and sauces. This series gives audiences a comprehensive idea of how certain ingredients have been traditionally used to produce the sought-after savoury-delicious taste.</p>\n",

Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence.

Newly-discovered home movies shine an intimate light into the lives of the elite.</p>\n<p>Through interviews with historians, writers and filmmakers, we reveal stories both epic and intimate.

It�s an elusive and lonely battle that few wish to talk about; but many form opinions on. So, what constitutes our mental health? Why does society shun conversations about and around the states of mental health?</p>\n<p>To find answers, we step into the world of four individuals dealing with different mental health issues, and listened. Strangers In My Head is a 4-part documentary series that journals the perspective of each individual as they reveal the layers of their relationship with mental health issues and what being �normal� means to them.</p>\n<p>This is an intimate introspection, an attempt to articulate the frustration, the guilt and the fatigue. Ultimately, through the many confusing voices and labels, they seek to assert their strength, identity and place in society.</p>\n",

The doubt betrays just how little some Singaporeans know about the backstory of our national songs.</p>\n\n<p>In this two-parter, award-winning singer-songwriter and one of lead singers of the 2021 national day theme song, Shabir, goes on a journey to document the origins of some of Singapore's most beloved national tunes.

But tunnelling on such a scale comes with challenges and to build within such a restricted space, the team has to employ state of the art machinery and technology. Next, the series takes a closer look at Singapore�s solar masterplan. Renewable energies like solar require land and to meet its targeted energy output by 2030, planners have to relook how space can be utilized more efficiently.
